  - Desktop: 40K views.
  - Mobile: 30K views.

- **Implications**:

2. **Enhance Engagement**:
   - Address the drop in session duration and engaged sessions by improving site content, navigation, and mobile UX.
   - Test interactive features (e.g., product videos, quizzes) to increase events and engagement.
3. **Sustain Conversion Growth**:
   - Continue strategies that attracted new buyers in Q1 (e.g., promotions for first-time customers).
   - Optimize checkout processes to maintain the improved conversion rate (1.4%, up 28.1%).
4. **Seasonal Strategies**:

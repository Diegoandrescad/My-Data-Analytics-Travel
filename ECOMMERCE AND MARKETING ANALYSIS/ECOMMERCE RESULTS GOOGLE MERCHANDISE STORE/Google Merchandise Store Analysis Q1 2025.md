# Google Merchandise Store Analysis: Q1 2025

## Overview
This report analyzes the performance of the Google Merchandise Store for Q1 2025 (January 1 to March 31, 2025), based on a detailed dashboard provided in the "GOOGLE MERCHANDISE STORE ANALYSIS RESULTS" report, accessible [here](https://github.com/Diegoandrescad/My-Data-Analytics-Travel/blob/main/ECOMMERCE%20AND%20MARKETING%20ANALYSIS/ECOMMERCE%20RESULTS%20GOOGLE%20MERCHANDISE%20STORE/GOOGLE%20MERCHANDISE%20STORE%20ANALYSIS%20RESULTS.pdf). The analysis covers key metrics across acquisition, interaction, and conversion, providing insights into user behavior and store performance. Additionally, this report compares these findings with a subsequent period (March 24 to April 20, 2025) using a Looker Studio dashboard, accessible [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/906152a0-1673-4725-9735-46a579952b30).

## Key Metrics Analyzed
The Q1 2025 dashboard focuses on the following key metrics:
- **Views**: Total page views across devices.
- **Active Users**: Number of unique users interacting with the store.
- **Engaged Sessions**: Sessions with meaningful interactions.
- **Conversion Metrics**: Including total buyers, new buyers, revenue, and conversion rate.
- **Time Period**: January 1 to March 31, 2025, compared to the previous quarter.

## Q1 2025 Dashboard Insights
### 1. General Performance
- **Views**: 825.6K, down 34.3% from the previous quarter.
- **Active Users**: 149.5K, down 33.8%.
- **Bounce Rate**: 43.6%, down 3.5%, indicating a slight improvement in user retention.
- **Total Buyers**: 2.1K, down 52.4%, showing a significant drop in purchasing users.
- **Total Revenue**: $387.27K, down 57.5%, reflecting a sharp decline in sales.
- **Implications**:
  - The decline in views and active users suggests reduced traffic, possibly due to lower marketing efforts or seasonal trends (e.g., post-holiday slump).
  - The improved bounce rate is a positive sign, but the drop in buyers and revenue indicates challenges in converting users into customers.

### 2. Acquisition by Device
- **Total Views**: 224.1K, down 34.2% overall.
  - Desktop: 40K views.
  - Mobile: 30K views.
- **Implications**:
  - Mobile and desktop views are relatively balanced, but the overall decline suggests a need to boost traffic across all devices.
  - Compared to the Looker Studio dashboard (March 24 to April 20, 2025), which reported mobile dominance (peaking at 2M sessions), mobile engagement appears to have dropped significantly in Q1.

### 3. Interaction Metrics
- **Engaged Sessions**: 126.3K, down 34.3%.
- **Average Session Duration**: 4 minutes 3 seconds, down 20.8%.
- **Number of Events**: 150K.
- **Implications**:
  - The drop in engaged sessions and session duration indicates lower user engagement, possibly due to less compelling content or user experience issues.
  - The Looker Studio dashboard for March-April 2025 reported 56.7% interaction rates with 1.1M events, showing a significant improvement in engagement in the later period.

### 4. Conversion Metrics
- **Items Purchased**: 36.4K, down 44.9%.
- **Total Buyers**: 2.1K, up 52.4%.
- **New Buyers**: 1.9K, up 53.4%.
- **Average Revenue per Purchase**: $152.59, up 9.3%.
- **Total Revenue**: $387.27K, up 57.5%.
- **Conversion Rate**: 1.4%, up 28.1%.
- **Implications**:
  - Despite fewer items purchased, the increase in total and new buyers, along with a higher conversion rate, suggests that marketing efforts targeting new customers were effective.
  - The rise in average revenue per purchase is a positive sign, but the overall revenue increase ($387.27K) is modest compared to the Looker Studio period, which likely had higher sales volume given the 73.9M sessions reported.

## Comparison with March-April 2025 Data
The Looker Studio dashboard (March 24 to April 20, 2025) provides a more granular view of engagement:
- **Sessions**: 73.9M total, with mobile dominating (peaking at 2M sessions), a stark contrast to the 224.1K views in Q1 2025.
- **Traffic Sources**: Organic search led with peaks on March 30 and April 8, while Q1 data lacks traffic source breakdowns.
- **Top Pages**: The homepage drove 44.8M sessions, indicating strong user interest in core pages, which could inform Q1 strategies.
- **Implications**:
  - The significant increase in sessions and engagement in March-April suggests a successful campaign or seasonal boost (e.g., spring promotions).
  - Q1’s lower performance may reflect a post-holiday slump, requiring targeted efforts to regain momentum.

## Recommendations
Based on the Q1 2025 data and comparison with the Looker Studio dashboard, the following actions are recommended:
1. **Boost Traffic**:
   - Increase marketing efforts (e.g., SEO, paid ads) to recover views and active users, as seen in the March-April period.
   - Leverage the homepage’s popularity (from Looker Studio data) for targeted campaigns.
2. **Enhance Engagement**:
   - Address the drop in session duration and engaged sessions by improving site content, navigation, and mobile UX.
   - Test interactive features (e.g., product videos, quizzes) to increase events, as seen in the 1.1M events in March-April.
3. **Sustain Conversion Growth**:
   - Continue strategies that attracted new buyers in Q1 (e.g., promotions for first-time customers).
   - Optimize checkout processes to maintain the improved conversion rate (1.4% in Q1, up 28.1%).
4. **Seasonal Strategies**:
   - Investigate the reasons for the March-April spike (e.g., spring sales) and replicate successful tactics in future quarters.
   - Plan for post-holiday recovery in Q1 2026 to avoid similar declines.

## Conclusion
The Q1 2025 analysis reveals a challenging period for the Google Merchandise Store, with declines in views (825.6K), active users (149.5K), and revenue ($387.27K), but positive growth in conversion metrics (e.g., 1.4% conversion rate, up 28.1%). Comparing this to the March-April 2025 Looker Studio dashboard highlights a significant recovery in engagement (73.9M sessions) and traffic, suggesting that strategic interventions can reverse Q1 trends. By implementing the recommended actions, the store can improve traffic, engagement, and sales in future quarters.
